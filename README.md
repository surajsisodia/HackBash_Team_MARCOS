# HackBash_Team_MARCOS
Repositoy for HackBash Hackathon
For a college student, it became very difficult to access various information related to academics and non-academics. The one has to rely on various sources(Whatsapp group, Discord, etc), going through moodle site, follow various cultural or technical club pages on social media, or ask batchmates.
These things often seems to be hectic and confusing for one, like from where to get information for particular thing.
So our idea is to ease out this process of searching and confusion. And making a student life easy by providing all the information, event and news, etc. at one place. So the student can focus more on his productive work rather than ending up searching and scrolling endless pages.

So we have an idea, why can't we build an simple app, to tackle all the above mentioned problems.
Followings will be our app's key features:
- College Bulletin Board
- Clubs Events (Posters + Information)
- Class/Lab Time Table
- Holiday information
- Hostel Mess Weekly menu
- Class Assignment Reminder
- Attendance Manager
- Academics Resources (PDF Books, Online lectures link, etc)
- Buying/Selling of stuffs (Calculators, drafters, bicycles, etc)
- Canteen Menu
- Direct registration links for various events
- Results
- Fees Record
